Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
RESULT: NATURAL LANGUAGE~

Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source code of.

Here are some metrics that we obtained on a desktop (dual opteron, 8GB RAM, 64-bit Ubuntu) running lots of other things along-with the tests. You can rerun these tests by using the class PerformanceTest.
RESULT: NATURAL LANGUAGE~

Note: Delete the disabled_ prefix to run these tests. We use this prefix to prevent running these tests every time we run JUnit tests.

Gson was originally created for use inside Google where it is currently used in a number of projects. It is now used by a number of public projects and companies. See details here.
RESULT: NATURAL LANGUAGE~

The primary class to use is Gson which you can just create by calling new Gson(). There is also a class GsonBuilder available that can be used to create a Gson instance with various settings like version control and so on.
RESULT: NATURAL LANGUAGE~

The Gson instance does not maintain any state while invoking Json operations. So, you are free to reuse the same object for multiple Json serialization and deserialization operations.

To use Gson with Maven2/3, you can use the Gson version available in Maven Central by adding the following dependency:

<pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">dependencies</span>&gt;
    <span class="pl-c">&lt;!--  Gson: Java to Json conversion --&gt;</span>
    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;com.google.code.gson&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;gson&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;2.5&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;
      &lt;<span class="pl-ent">scope</span>&gt;compile&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">scope</span>&gt;
    &lt;/<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">dependencies</span>&gt;</pre>
